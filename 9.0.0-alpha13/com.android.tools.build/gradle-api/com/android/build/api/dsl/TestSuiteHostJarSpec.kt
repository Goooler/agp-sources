     * properties file with the following keys:
     *
     * `android_resource_apk`: the path to the APK-like zip file containing merged resources, which

     *
     * `android_merged_assets`: the path to the directory containing merged assets. The merged
     * assets directory contains assets from the current subproject and it dependencies.
     *
     * `android_merged_manifest`: the path to the merged manifest file. Only app subprojects have
     * the manifest merged from their dependencies. Library subprojects do not include manifest
     * components from their dependencies.
     *
     * `android_custom_package`: the package name (namespace) of the final R class.
