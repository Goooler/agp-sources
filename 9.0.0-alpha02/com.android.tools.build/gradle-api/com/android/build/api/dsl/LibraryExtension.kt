    /**
     * Encapsulates all product flavors configurations for this project.
     *
     * Product flavors represent different versions of your project that you expect to co-exist
     * on a single device, the Google Play store, or repository. For example, you can configure
     * 'demo' and 'full' product flavors for your app, and each of those flavors can specify
     * different features, device requirements, resources, and application ID's--while sharing
     * common source code and resources. So, product flavors allow you to output different versions
     * of your project by simply changing only the components and settings that are different
     * between them.
     *
     *
     * Configuring product flavors is similar to
     * [configuring build types](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html#build-types):
     * add them to the `productFlavors` block of your project's `build.gradle` file
     * and configure the settings you want.
     * Product flavors support the same properties as the `defaultConfig`
     * block--this is because `defaultConfig` defines an object that the plugin uses as the base
     * configuration for all other flavors. Each flavor you configure can then override any of the
     * default values in `defaultConfig`, such as the
     * [`applicationId`](https://d.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
     *
     *
     * When using Android plugin 3.0.0 and higher, *each flavor must belong to a
     * [`flavorDimension`](com.android.build.gradle.BaseExtension.html#com.android.build.gradle.BaseExtension:flavorDimensions(java.lang.String[]))
     * value*. By default, when you specify only one
     * dimension, all flavors you configure belong to that dimension. If you specify more than one
     * flavor dimension, you need to manually assign each flavor to a dimension. To learn more, read
     * [Use Flavor Dimensions for variant-aware dependency management](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration.html#variant_aware).
     *
     *
     * When you configure product flavors, the Android plugin automatically combines them with
     * your [LibraryBuildType] configurations to
     * [create build variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html).
     * If the plugin creates certain build variants that you don't want, you can
     * [filter variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html#filter-variants).
